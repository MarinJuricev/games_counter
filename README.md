# Game Counter

A universal game counter which can be used in various games.
My friends and I like to play different boardgames and most of the time we used pen & paper to keep
the score.

Since I started learning Flutter why not fix that issue.

### Architecture

The overall app architecture heavily borrows from Uncle Bobâ€™s Clean Architecture.

For the presentation layer the BLOC design pattern was used.

During the development of the project, strict TDD was followed.
The domain/data layers are fully tested, while inside the presentation layer only the blocs are unit tested, didn't dip my toe in widget tests yet.

# TODOS:
  - [ ] History with local persistence
  - [ ] Settings
  - [ ] Delete Player
  - [ ] End game sooner feature, since not all games have a point limit.
  - [ ] Many more...
